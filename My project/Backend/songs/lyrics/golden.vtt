00:16.05 --> 00:17.12
I was a ghost

00:17.12 --> 00:19.00
I was alone, ha

00:19.00 --> 00:21.07
어두워진 Ha

00:21.07 --> 00:23.90
앞길 속에

00:23.90 --> 00:24.88
Given the throne

00:24.88 --> 00:26.10
I didn't know

00:26.10 --> 00:28.03
How to believe

00:28.03 --> 00:30.79
I was the queen that I'm meant to be

00:30.79 --> 00:32.48
I lived two lives

00:32.48 --> 00:34.61
Tried to play both sides

00:34.61 --> 00:38.30
But I couldn't find my own place

00:38.30 --> 00:40.32
Called a problem child

00:40.32 --> 00:42.51
'Cause I got too wild

00:42.51 --> 00:45.57
But now that's how I'm getting paid

00:45.57 --> 00:46.78
끝없이 On stage

00:46.78 --> 00:54.12
I'm done hiding, now I'm shining like I'm born to be

00:54.12 --> 01:01.51
We dreamin' hard, we came so far, now I believe

01:01.51 --> 01:03.78
We're goin' up, up, up

01:03.78 --> 01:05.38
It's our moment

01:05.38 --> 01:07.35
You know together we're glowing

01:07.35 --> 01:09.25
Gonna be, gonna be golden

01:09.25 --> 01:11.58
Oh, up, up, up

01:11.58 --> 01:13.25
With our voices

01:13.25 --> 01:15.16
영원히 깨질 수 없는

01:15.16 --> 01:17.10
Gonna be, gonna be golden

01:17.10 --> 01:25.34
Oh, I'm done hiding, now I'm shining like I'm born to be

01:25.34 --> 01:33.12
Oh, our time, no fears, no lies, that's who we're born to be

01:35.05 --> 01:39.15
Waited so long to break these walls down

01:39.15 --> 01:43.14
To wake up and feel like me

01:43.14 --> 01:47.00
Put these patterns all in the past now

01:47.00 --> 01:50.60
And finally live like the girl they all see

01:51.60 --> 01:59.18
No more hiding, I'll be shining like I'm born to be

01:59.18 --> 02:06.95
'Cause we are hunters, voices strong, and I know I believe

02:06.95 --> 02:09.27
We're goin' up, up, up

02:09.27 --> 02:10.90
It's our moment

02:10.90 --> 02:12.82
You know together we're glowing

02:12.82 --> 02:14.72
Gonna be, gonna be golden

02:14.72 --> 02:17.10
Oh, up, up, up

02:17.10 --> 02:18.70
With our voices

02:18.70 --> 02:20.64
영원히 깨질 수 없는

02:20.64 --> 02:22.60
Gonna be, gonna be golden

02:22.60 --> 02:30.82
Oh, I'm done hiding, now I'm shining like I'm born to be

02:30.82 --> 02:38.07
Oh, our time, no fears, no lies, that's who we're born to be

02:38.20 --> 02:39.18
You know we're

02:39.18 --> 02:40.92
Gonna be, gonna be golden

02:40.92 --> 02:43.00
We're gonna be, gonna be

02:43.00 --> 02:44.91
Born to be, born to be glowin'

02:44.91 --> 02:46.32
밝게 빛나는 우리

02:46.32 --> 02:54.55
You know that it's our time, no fears, no lies, that's who we're born to be

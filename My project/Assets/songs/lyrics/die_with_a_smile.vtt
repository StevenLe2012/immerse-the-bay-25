00:04.15 --> 00:09.61
(Ooh, ooh)

00:09.61 --> 00:16.12
I, I just woke up from a dream

00:16.12 --> 00:20.85
Where you and I had to say goodbye

00:20.85 --> 00:25.25
And I don't know what it all means

00:25.25 --> 00:29.26
But since I survived, I realized

00:29.26 --> 00:34.65
Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow

00:34.65 --> 00:38.78
Nobody's promised tomorrow

00:38.78 --> 00:42.97
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night

00:42.97 --> 00:45.30
Like it's the last night

00:45.30 --> 00:48.18
If the world was ending

00:48.18 --> 00:54.30
I'd wanna be next to you

00:54.30 --> 00:56.95
If the party was over

00:56.95 --> 01:03.50
And our time on Earth was through

01:03.50 --> 01:08.17
I'd wanna hold you just for a while

01:08.17 --> 01:12.70
And die with a smile

01:12.70 --> 01:15.59
If the world was ending

01:15.59 --> 01:21.50
I'd wanna be next to you

01:21.50 --> 01:26.05
(Ooh, ooh)

01:26.05 --> 01:33.78
Ooh, lost, lost in the words that we scream

01:33.78 --> 01:38.12
I don't even wanna do this anymore

01:38.12 --> 01:41.90
'Cause you already know what you mean to me

01:41.90 --> 01:47.30
And our love's the only one worth fighting for

01:47.30 --> 01:51.97
Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow

01:51.97 --> 01:56.23
Nobody's promised tomorrow

01:56.23 --> 02:00.24
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night

02:00.24 --> 02:02.66
Like it's the last night

02:02.66 --> 02:05.67
If the world was ending

02:05.67 --> 02:11.77
I'd wanna be next to you

02:11.77 --> 02:14.45
If the party was over

02:14.45 --> 02:20.90
And our time on Earth was through

02:20.90 --> 02:25.59
I'd wanna hold you just for a while

02:25.59 --> 02:29.92
And die with a smile

02:29.92 --> 02:33.09
If the world was ending

02:33.09 --> 02:38.52
I'd wanna be next to you

02:38.52 --> 02:43.36
Right next to you

02:43.36 --> 02:48.04
Next to you

02:48.04 --> 02:51.42
Right next to you

02:51.42 --> 03:10.72
Oh-oh

03:10.72 --> 03:13.90
If the world was ending

03:13.90 --> 03:20.09
I'd wanna be next to you

03:20.09 --> 03:22.82
If the party was over

03:22.82 --> 03:28.97
And our time on Earth was through

03:28.97 --> 03:33.79
I'd wanna hold you just for a while

03:33.79 --> 03:38.26
And die with a smile

03:38.26 --> 03:41.20
If the world was ending

03:41.20 --> 03:47.18
I'd wanna be next to you

03:47.18 --> 03:50.29
If the world was ending

03:50.29 --> 03:56.24
I'd wanna be next to you

03:56.24 --> 03:59.30
(Ooh, ooh)

03:59.30 --> 04:23.00
I'd wanna be next to you

00:01.94 --> 00:06.04
You know I want you

00:06.04 --> 00:09.74
It's not a secret I try to hide

00:09.74 --> 00:13.18
You know you want me

00:13.18 --> 00:17.04
So don't keep saying our hands are tied

00:17.04 --> 00:19.40
You claim it's not in the cards

00:19.40 --> 00:22.43
And fate is pulling you miles away

00:22.43 --> 00:24.84
And out of a reach from me

00:24.84 --> 00:26.71
But you're hearing my heart

00:26.71 --> 00:28.40
So who can stop me if I decide it's on my destiny?

00:34.94 --> 00:38.92
What if we rewrite the stars?

00:38.92 --> 00:42.76
Say you were made to be mine

00:42.76 --> 00:46.40
Nothing could keep us apart

00:46.40 --> 00:50.07
You'll be the one I was meant to find

00:50.07 --> 00:54.06
It's up to you, and it's up to me

00:54.06 --> 00:57.83
No one could say what we get to be

00:57.83 --> 01:01.80
So why don't we rewrite the stars?

01:01.80 --> 01:03.63
And maybe the world could be ours, tonight

01:14.23 --> 01:17.70
You think it's easy

01:17.70 --> 01:21.79
You think I don't wanna run to you, yeah

01:21.79 --> 01:26.02
But there are mountains (But there are mountains)

01:26.02 --> 01:29.80
And there are doors that we can't walk through

01:29.80 --> 01:31.34
I know you're wondering why

01:31.34 --> 01:37.55
Because we're able to be just you and me within these walls

01:37.55 --> 01:39.43
But when we go outside

01:39.43 --> 01:41.13
You're gonna wake up and see that it was hopeless after all

01:47.15 --> 01:51.04
No one can rewrite the stars

01:51.04 --> 01:54.46
How can you say you'll be mine?

01:54.46 --> 01:58.82
Everything keeps us apart

01:58.82 --> 02:02.59
And I'm not the one you were meant to find

02:02.59 --> 02:06.51
It's not up to you, it's not up to me, yeah

02:06.51 --> 02:10.05
When everyone tells us what we can be

02:10.05 --> 02:14.20
And how can we rewrite the stars?

02:14.20 --> 02:16.13
Say that the world can be ours, tonight

02:19.18 --> 02:23.61
All I want is to fly with you

02:23.61 --> 02:27.01
All I want is to fall with you

02:27.01 --> 02:30.97
So just give me all of you

02:30.97 --> 02:33.71
It feels impossible (It's not impossible)

02:33.71 --> 02:35.50
Is it impossible?

02:35.50 --> 02:37.79
Say that it's possible

02:39.13 --> 02:42.89
And how do we rewrite the stars?

02:42.89 --> 02:46.62
Say you were made to be mine

02:46.62 --> 02:50.26
And nothing can keep us apart

02:50.26 --> 02:54.27
'Cause you are the one I was meant to find

02:54.27 --> 02:57.97
It's up to you, and it's up to me

02:57.97 --> 03:01.91
No one could say what we get to be

03:01.91 --> 03:05.76
And why don't we rewrite the stars?

03:05.76 --> 03:08.92
Changing the world to be ours

03:17.94 --> 03:22.50
You know I want you

03:22.50 --> 03:25.66
It's not a secret I try to hide

03:25.66 --> 03:29.14
But I can't have you

03:29.14 --> 03:32.57
We're bound to break and my hands are tied

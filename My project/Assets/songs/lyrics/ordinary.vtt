00:08.14 --> 00:14.19
They say the holy water's watered down and this town's lost its faith

00:14.19 --> 00:17.36
Our colors will fade eventually

00:17.36 --> 00:22.71
So if our time is running out day after day

00:22.71 --> 00:26.34
We'll make the mundane our masterpiece

00:26.67 --> 00:30.46
Oh my, my, oh my, my

00:30.46 --> 00:34.08
Love, I take one look at you

00:34.04 --> 00:37.94
You're taking me out of the ordinary

00:37.94 --> 00:42.31
I want you laying me down till we're dead and buried

00:42.31 --> 00:47.37
On the edge of your knife, staying drunk on your vine

00:47.37 --> 00:51.29
The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowing we found

00:51.29 --> 00:54.93
Something so out of the ordinary

00:54.93 --> 00:59.39
You got me kissing the ground of your sanctuary

00:59.39 --> 01:04.49
Shatter me with your touch, oh Lord, return me to dust

01:04.49 --> 01:09.52
The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowing we found

01:10.02 --> 01:14.30
Hopeless hallelujah

01:14.30 --> 01:18.65
Oh, this side of Heaven's gate

01:18.65 --> 01:22.96
Oh, my life, how do ya

01:22.96 --> 01:28.01
Breathe and take my breath away?

01:28.01 --> 01:30.20
At your altar, I will pray

01:30.20 --> 01:32.20
You're the sculptor, I'm the clay

01:32.85 --> 01:34.05
Oh my, my

01:34.05 --> 01:37.91
You're taking me out of the ordinary

01:37.91 --> 01:42.19
I want you laying me down till we're dead and buried

01:42.19 --> 01:47.34
On the edge of your knife, staying drunk on your vine

01:47.34 --> 01:51.30
The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowing we found

01:51.30 --> 01:55.10
Something so out of the ordinary

01:55.10 --> 01:59.32
You got me kissing the ground of your sanctuary

01:59.32 --> 02:04.57
Shatter me with your touch, oh Lord, return me to dust

02:04.57 --> 02:09.37
The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowing we found

02:09.49 --> 02:11.62
Something so heavenly

02:11.62 --> 02:16.07
Higher than ecstasy whenever you're next to me

02:16.07 --> 02:22.34
Oh my, my world was in black and white until I saw your light

02:22.34 --> 02:26.68
I thought you had to die to find something so out

02:26.96 --> 02:29.29
Of the ordinary

02:29.29 --> 02:33.61
I want you laying me down till we're dead and buried

02:33.61 --> 02:38.81
On the edge of your knife, staying drunk on your vine

02:38.81 --> 02:42.69
The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowing we found

02:42.69 --> 02:46.51
Something so out of the ordinary

02:46.51 --> 02:50.76
You got me kissing the ground of your sanctuary

02:50.76 --> 02:55.95
Shatter me with your touch, oh Lord, return me to dust

02:55.95 --> 03:00.84
The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowing we found

00:05.80 --> 00:08.27
Nice to meet you, where you been?

00:08.27 --> 00:10.79
I could show you incredible things

00:10.79 --> 00:13.28
Magic, madness, heaven, sin

00:13.28 --> 00:15.20
Saw you there and I thought

00:15.20 --> 00:17.73
"Oh my God, look at that face

00:17.73 --> 00:20.21
You look like my next mistake

00:20.21 --> 00:24.09
Love's a game, wanna play?"

00:24.25 --> 00:28.24
Aye, new money, suit and tie

00:28.24 --> 00:30.83
I can read you like a magazine

00:30.83 --> 00:33.31
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly

00:33.31 --> 00:37.55
And I know you heard about me, so hey, let's be friends

00:37.55 --> 00:40.21
I'm dyin' to see how this one ends

00:40.21 --> 00:42.69
Grab your passport and my hand

00:42.69 --> 00:45.38
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

00:45.38 --> 00:47.98
So it's gonna be forever

00:47.98 --> 00:50.52
Or it's gonna go down in flames

00:50.52 --> 00:53.01
You can tell me when it's over, mmm

00:53.01 --> 00:55.47
If the high was worth the pain

00:55.47 --> 00:57.99
Got a long list of ex-lovers

00:57.99 --> 01:00.48
They'll tell you I'm insane

01:00.48 --> 01:03.00
'Cause you know I love the players

01:03.00 --> 01:05.47
And you love the game

01:05.47 --> 01:07.99
'Cause we're young and we're reckless

01:07.99 --> 01:10.51
We'll take this way too far

01:10.51 --> 01:13.00
It'll leave you breathless, mmm

01:13.00 --> 01:15.47
Or with a nasty scar

01:15.47 --> 01:18.00
Got a long list of ex-lovers

01:18.00 --> 01:20.63
They'll tell you I'm insane

01:20.63 --> 01:24.08
But I've got a blank space, baby

01:24.08 --> 01:25.83
And I'll write your name

01:30.75 --> 01:33.34
Cherry lips, crystal skies

01:33.34 --> 01:35.73
I could show you incredible things

01:35.73 --> 01:38.36
Stolen kisses, pretty lies

01:38.36 --> 01:40.49
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen

01:40.49 --> 01:42.71
Find out what you want

01:42.71 --> 01:45.21
Be that girl for a month

01:45.21 --> 01:50.60
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no

01:50.69 --> 01:53.34
Screaming, crying, perfect storms

01:53.34 --> 01:55.81
I can make all the tables turn

01:55.81 --> 01:58.35
Rose garden filled with thorns

01:58.35 --> 02:00.17
Keep you second-guessin' like

02:00.17 --> 02:02.67
"Oh my God, who is she?"

02:02.67 --> 02:05.02
I get drunk on jealousy

02:05.02 --> 02:07.54
But you'll come back each time you leave

02:07.54 --> 02:10.38
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

02:10.42 --> 02:12.98
So it's gonna be forever

02:12.98 --> 02:15.48
Or it's gonna go down in flames

02:15.48 --> 02:18.00
You can tell me when it's over, mmm

02:18.00 --> 02:20.47
If the high was worth the pain

02:20.47 --> 02:23.01

02:27.99 --> 02:30.47

02:32.98 --> 02:35.48

02:35.48 --> 02:38.00
It'll leave you breathless, mmm

02:38.00 --> 02:40.46
Or with a nasty scar

02:40.46 --> 02:42.98
Got a long list of ex-lovers

02:42.98 --> 02:45.64
They'll tell you I'm insane

02:45.64 --> 02:49.09
But I've got a blank space, baby

02:49.09 --> 02:50.55
And I'll write your name

02:50.55 --> 02:55.53
Boys only want love if it's torture

02:55.53 --> 03:00.49
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

03:00.49 --> 03:05.45
Boys only want love if it's torture

03:05.45 --> 03:13.67
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

03:10.42 --> 03:13.00
So it's gonna be forever

03:13.00 --> 03:15.51

03:25.49 --> 03:27.97
'Cause you know I love the players

03:27.97 --> 03:30.48
And you love the game

03:30.48 --> 03:32.93
'Cause we're young and we're reckless

03:32.93 --> 03:35.54

03:49.10 --> 03:50.92
And I'll write your name

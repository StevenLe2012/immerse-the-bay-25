Taylor Swift ~ You Belong With Me

00:07.51 --> 00:11.51
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset

00:11.51 --> 00:15.24
She's goin' off about somethin' that you said

00:15.24 --> 00:22.27
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do

00:22.27 --> 00:26.15
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night

00:26.15 --> 00:30.13
I'm listenin' to the kind of music she doesn't like

00:30.13 --> 00:36.82
And she'll never know your story like I do

00:36.82 --> 00:40.67
But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts

00:40.67 --> 00:44.36
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers

00:44.36 --> 00:47.40
Dreamin' 'bout the day when you wake up and find

00:47.40 --> 00:51.12
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

00:51.12 --> 00:55.51
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you

00:55.51 --> 01:01.69
Been here all along, so why can't you see

01:01.69 --> 01:05.06
You belong with me

01:05.06 --> 01:10.25
You belong with me

01:10.25 --> 01:14.23
Walkin' the streets with you and your worn-out jeans

01:14.23 --> 01:18.02
I can't help thinkin' this is how it ought to be

01:18.02 --> 01:21.68
Laughin' on a park bench, thinkin' to myself

01:21.68 --> 01:24.90
"Hey, isn't this easy?"

01:24.90 --> 01:28.92
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town

01:28.92 --> 01:32.67
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down

01:32.67 --> 01:35.91
You say you're fine, I know you better than that

01:35.91 --> 01:39.68
Hey, what you doin' with a girl like that?

01:39.68 --> 01:43.53
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers

01:43.53 --> 01:47.07
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers

01:47.07 --> 01:50.14
Dreamin' 'bout the day when you wake up and find

01:50.14 --> 01:53.86
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

01:53.86 --> 01:58.08
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you

01:58.08 --> 02:04.22
Been here all along, so why can't you see

02:04.22 --> 02:09.25
You belong with me

02:09.25 --> 02:12.91
Standin' by and waitin' at your back door

02:12.91 --> 02:18.97
All this time, how could you not know, baby

02:18.97 --> 02:22.65
You belong with me

02:22.65 --> 02:37.09
You belong with me

02:37.09 --> 02:40.35
Oh, I remember you drivin' to my house

02:40.35 --> 02:42.14
In the middle of the night

02:42.14 --> 02:44.06
I'm the one who makes you laugh

02:44.06 --> 02:45.87
When you know you're 'bout to cry

02:45.87 --> 02:47.70
And I know your favorite songs

02:47.70 --> 02:49.56
And you tell me 'bout your dreams

02:49.56 --> 02:51.51
Think I know where you belong

02:51.51 --> 02:54.89
Think I know it's with me

02:54.89 --> 02:59.10
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you?

02:59.10 --> 03:05.04
Been here all along, so why can't you see

03:05.04 --> 03:10.20
You belong with me

03:10.20 --> 03:13.90
Standin' by and waitin' at your back door

03:13.90 --> 03:19.92
All this time, how could you not know, baby

03:19.92 --> 03:23.53
You belong with me

03:23.53 --> 03:27.29
You belong with me

03:27.29 --> 03:30.07
You belong with me

03:30.07 --> 03:34.71
Have you ever thought just maybe

03:34.71 --> 03:38.34
You belong with me

03:38.34 --> 03:45.00
You belong with me

00:00.38 --> 00:04.33
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

00:04.33 --> 00:07.68
Ooh-ooh-ooh

00:07.68 --> 00:17.87
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

00:17.87 --> 00:19.59
I could say I never dare

00:19.59 --> 00:22.02
To think about you in that way

00:22.02 --> 00:26.46
But, I would be lying

00:26.46 --> 00:28.39
And I pretend I’m happy for you

00:28.39 --> 00:31.84
When you find some dude to take home

00:31.84 --> 00:34.25
But, I won’t deny that

00:34.25 --> 00:37.03
In the midst of the crowds

00:37.03 --> 00:39.01
In the shapes in the clouds

00:39.01 --> 00:43.49
I don’t see nobody but you

00:43.49 --> 00:45.66
In my rose-tinted dreams

00:45.66 --> 00:47.83
Wrinkled silk on my sheets

00:47.83 --> 00:52.77
I don’t see nobody but you

00:52.77 --> 00:55.00
Boy, you got me hooked on to something

00:55.00 --> 00:57.16
Who could say that they saw us coming?

00:57.16 --> 01:01.67
Tell me, do you feel the love?

01:01.67 --> 01:03.82
Spend the summer of a lifetime with me

01:03.82 --> 01:06.03
Let me take you to the place of your dreams

01:06.03 --> 01:10.50
Tell me, do you feel the love?

01:10.50 --> 01:19.53
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

01:19.53 --> 01:21.60
And I could say I never answered

01:21.60 --> 01:24.84
Those believers inside my head

01:24.84 --> 01:27.24
But that’s far from the truth

01:27.24 --> 01:30.14
Don’t know what’s come over me

01:30.14 --> 01:33.12
It seems like yesterday when I said

01:33.12 --> 01:36.60
“We’ll be friends forever”

01:36.60 --> 01:38.52
Constellations of stars

01:38.52 --> 01:40.83
Murals on city walls

01:40.83 --> 01:45.50
I don’t see nobody but you

01:45.50 --> 01:47.38
You’re my vice, you’re my muse

01:47.38 --> 01:49.49
You’re a nineteenth floor view

01:49.49 --> 01:54.48
I don’t see nobody but you

01:54.48 --> 01:56.61
Boy, you got me hooked on to something

01:56.61 --> 01:58.75
Who could say that they saw us coming?

01:58.75 --> 02:03.36
Tell me, do you feel the love?

02:03.36 --> 02:05.45
Spend the summer of a lifetime with me

02:05.45 --> 02:07.90
Let me take you to the place of your dreams

02:07.90 --> 02:12.00
Tell me, do you feel the love?

02:12.00 --> 02:14.30
Boy, you got me hooked on to something

02:14.30 --> 02:16.27
Who could say that they saw us coming?

02:16.27 --> 02:20.88
Tell me, do you feel the love?

02:20.88 --> 02:22.87
Spend the summer of a lifetime with me

02:22.87 --> 02:25.52
Let me take you to the place of your dreams

02:25.52 --> 02:26.86
Tell me, do you feel the love?

02:26.86 --> 02:31.09
Do you feel the love? (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

02:31.09 --> 02:32.65
Do you feel the love?

02:32.65 --> 02:37.63
Do you feel the love?

02:37.63 --> 02:41.80
Do you feel the love?

02:41.80 --> 02:47.01
Feel the love

02:47.01 --> 02:50.00
Feel the love

00:13.29 --> 00:19.96
Same bed, but it feels just a little bit bigger now

00:19.96 --> 00:26.44
Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same

00:26.44 --> 00:33.06
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down

00:33.06 --> 00:37.11
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

00:37.45 --> 00:45.56
It all just sounds like

00:45.56 --> 00:49.92
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize

00:50.43 --> 00:54.71
That I should've bought you flowers

00:54.71 --> 00:57.10
And held your hand

00:57.10 --> 01:01.10
Should've gave you all my hours

01:01.10 --> 01:03.79
When I had the chance

01:03.79 --> 01:06.23
Take you to every party

01:06.23 --> 01:10.49
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance

01:10.49 --> 01:13.56
Now my baby's dancing

01:13.56 --> 01:16.55
But she's dancing with another man

01:22.45 --> 01:29.01
My pride, my ego, my needs and my selfish ways

01:29.01 --> 01:34.62
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life

01:34.62 --> 01:42.18
Now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh

01:42.18 --> 01:46.56
And that haunts me every time I close my eyes

01:46.56 --> 01:54.69
It all just sounds like

01:54.69 --> 01:59.45
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize

01:59.45 --> 02:03.79
That I should've bought you flowers

02:03.79 --> 02:06.11
And held your hand

02:06.11 --> 02:10.12
Should've gave you all my hours

02:10.12 --> 02:12.71
When I had the chance

02:12.71 --> 02:15.26
Take you to every party

02:15.26 --> 02:19.45
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance

02:19.45 --> 02:22.57
Now my baby's dancing

02:22.57 --> 02:25.82
But she's dancing with another man

02:26.80 --> 02:29.96
Although it hurts

02:29.96 --> 02:39.68
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong

02:39.68 --> 02:43.14
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late

02:43.14 --> 02:46.57
To try and apologize for my mistakes

02:46.57 --> 02:52.04
But I just want you to know

02:52.04 --> 02:56.09
I hope he buys you flowers

02:56.09 --> 02:59.40
I hope he holds your hand

02:59.40 --> 03:03.00
Give you all his hours

03:03.00 --> 03:06.21
When he has the chance

03:06.21 --> 03:08.44
Take you to every party

03:08.44 --> 03:12.50
'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance

03:12.50 --> 03:16.70
Do all the things I should've done

03:16.70 --> 03:19.23
When I was your man

03:19.23 --> 03:24.53
Do all the things I should've done

03:24.53 --> 03:27.13
When I was your man

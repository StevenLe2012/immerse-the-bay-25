00:00.41 --> 00:05.73
My chest is hurting, my feet can't fall out of bed

00:05.73 --> 00:10.45
I don't know where to go, so I'll lay here instead

00:10.45 --> 00:15.21
With my symptoms, symptoms of sorrow and dread

00:15.21 --> 00:20.42
They all said it would fade, but again and again

00:20.42 --> 00:25.20
I love, I love

00:25.20 --> 00:29.99
I love, I love, I love

00:29.99 --> 00:39.40
I love, I love, I love

00:41.24 --> 00:44.62
I've been so busy

00:44.62 --> 00:47.22
But now that I'm alone

00:47.22 --> 00:48.09
Where did you go?

00:48.09 --> 00:52.01
Tell me why

00:52.01 --> 00:58.87
Why can't you live at home tonight and stay with me inside?

00:58.87 --> 01:02.77
It's nice

01:02.77 --> 01:07.69
Please, I wanna see what we would be if you were by my side

01:07.69 --> 01:10.05
Make me feel lonely, soon

01:10.05 --> 01:14.70
You might not know me, I wish I could lie

01:14.70 --> 01:16.83
But I can't deny

01:17.24 --> 01:22.49
My chest is hurting, my feet can't fall out of bed

01:22.49 --> 01:27.29
I don't know where to go, so I'll lay here instead

01:27.29 --> 01:31.99
With my symptoms, symptoms of sorrow and dread

01:31.99 --> 01:37.25
They all said it would fade, but again and again

01:37.25 --> 01:41.99
I love, I love

01:41.99 --> 01:46.79
I love, I love, I love

01:46.79 --> 01:55.75
I love, I love, I love

02:16.83 --> 02:20.08
I'm hurting, I'm stuck in my bed

02:20.08 --> 02:24.83
I don't know where to go, so I'll lay here instead

02:24.83 --> 02:29.64
With my symptoms, symptoms of sorrow and dread

02:29.64 --> 02:34.93
They all said it would fade, but again and again

02:34.93 --> 02:39.61
I love, I love

02:39.61 --> 02:44.46
I love, I love, I love

02:44.46 --> 02:49.23
I love, I love

02:49.23 --> 02:54.42
I love, I love, I love
